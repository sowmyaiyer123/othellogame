* The solution implements a 2 player console application.
* The 2 players can continue playing till such a condition is reached that none of them can make a move or one of them has won the game.
* The console displays errors if an occupied tile is chosen or if a wrong tile is chosen. or if wrong input is provided
* Have written tests, one testing the initial board condition and the other simulating the entire game flow by generating random numbers between 1 and 8 for row and column number to choose a tile on the board
* Further enhancements possible : 1) Extending java applets and converting this into a UI application. 2) Rather than a 2 human players, one player logic can be converted to randomized computer strategies/ alogorithms 3) Hosting this as a service for consumption
* Core classes: GameBoard, ScoreBoard, TileState, Player, GameBoardLogic
